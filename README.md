Because the reports I wrote were for clients, I cannot share them out of confidentiality. Please click on "Syracuse Pride Report.pdf" above to view a writing sample of a report I wrote out of personal curiosity. All respondents surveyed in this report consented to my sharing of their responses. The writing sample exhibits the sections and writing style I use in data analytics reports.
